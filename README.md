# odin-recipes

## Description
This my first project as part of The Odin Project foundation path.

## Goals
At the end of this project, I should be able to demonstrate how to set up a simple website that showcases recipes.
This should highlight my understanding of basic HTML and my familiarity with foundation git commands.
